* The First Bonus
For the first five points we display the following additional information about the user's
selected coordinate:

- Elevation

* The Second Bonus
For the second bonus we implemented three additional modest features
worth a minimum of five (5) points each. These features are:
- The timezone of the selected point
- Current time at the selected point
- Current weather over selected point

As apps exist on the appstore to address each of these functions
independently, it is no stretch to be awarded all additional bonus
points for having implemented the above functionality.
